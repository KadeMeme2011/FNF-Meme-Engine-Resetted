# Friday Night Funkin' - Meme Engine: Resetted
The AWESOME FNF Engine ever!1!



## About
Meme Engine Resetted is a P-Slice Modification which adds MORE (Kinda Useful) FEATURES to the Engine

This Includes:
* Custom Variations (because only erect is the only variant in p=slice)
* Startup/Splash Screen (CUSTOMIZABLE) maybe
* GameJolt API (Source Code only sadly)
* DLCs or Addons (idk why but we'll see)
* Extra Content (so that you know how things work)
* Week BG Colors! (it's fun for people who dont want to make a Week BG Sprite)
* Unlockable Playable Characters (idk how but we'll see if it works or nah)

## W.I.P
if you don't see anything in the source code, this means that the source code isn't public, so keep in mind that
